prepproject
===========

a simple solution for project setup
-----------------------------------

Or, at least, my solution to creating directory structure, setting up git, gulp, mocha, chai, and jshint.  It even makes a gulpfile and walks you through making a package.json.  Awesome!

The following packages will be installed into target directories as dev-dependencies:

* gulp
* gulp-mocha
* chai
* gulp-jshint

The following packages are dependencies for this program:

* npm (the best)
* prompt (thanks jcrugzz!)

YMMV, some rights reserved, and stuff.

Just `npm install prepproject`
and then `prepproject` in the directory of your choice.
